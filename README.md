# Description
Ever wondered what was your cat thoughts ? Here is the answer !!!

Seriously it is only a small project wich is meant to make me discover API platform and postman unit tests BE side and Axios FE side.

With this project i'm working with my beloved Symfony on API, JWT, and unit test with postman. I also made a very simple integration workflow with just a phpLinter. The goal was to get an overview of github actions and workflows to do something a bit similar as a CI environment.

Front-End side i'm using a litlle bit of bootstrap, flex properties, vanilla JS and Axios library to make requests to my API. There's also http-server node module to run the webpage.

PS: I'm tryin to make a well documented project so i get use to be a good collegue !!!
